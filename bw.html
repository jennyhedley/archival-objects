          <h2>Mother loved photography, me and cats</h2>
          <p>
            Here I am with my cat when we lived in the mountains. The 35mm film
            negative for this is possibly in storage. She might have developed
            the image herself. She, and later I, would convert our bathrooms to
            darkrooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day this cat scaled a tall pine tree. It could have been one
            hundred years old. It was unclimbable, even for me. My mother called
            the fire department and they extended the ladder up to rescue our
            cat, who later had babies with her brother. She gave birth to a litter of six
            in my closet.

  This photo would recreate itself many times

          <p>
            ... and with many cats, most of whom were not mine.

             These cats might have considered, however, that I was <i>theirs</i>.
