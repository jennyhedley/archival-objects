          <h2>From 'Spiritual Practice' (unpublished) by Anne Wallace</h2>
          <p>
'The first time we sat at the table with Mrs. Bowdle, she scooted her chair in and leaned closer to us. Her giant breasts spread across the table and up against her <i>King James II Bible</i> and Mary Baker Eddyâ€™s <i>Science and Health</i>. She held blue chalk in her fingers, and occasionally it would get on her face or teeth after marking passages for us to read. How we loved that blue chalk. Her hair was done up in a loose bun and she always wore <strong>pearls</strong> and dresses and high heels, and when she smiled, there was gold in her teeth.'
