          <h2>From 'Body Comfort' (unpublished) by Anne Wallace</h2>
          <p>
'In the senior residence, her meals are prepared for her, housekeeping provided, and daily activities arranged. There is a bridge group that meets after lunch, and movies or entertainment in the recreation room. Someone thinks to brighten her pre-furnished room with her favorite reading chair and afghan throw. Another brings in some paintings, lamps, and vases she'd recognize as "home." <strong>Photographs</strong> of family on her nightstand. Great-grandchildren's drawings tacked to walls. Gifts of chocolates or fresh cut flowers. There is a plain dressing table with her favorite pink lipsticks, powders, comb and brush, and tiny glass vials of perfume. My mother tells me that several of her mother's long-time friends, all widows, are also living in the center, but when we attempt to reacquaint them at meals in the dining room, they do not remember who she is, or for that matter, who they are. They are very polite, though, and take her hand, saying over and over, "Very nice to meet you."'
