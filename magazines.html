‘Anne was a master storyteller. Reading her work, one becomes immersed in the people and places she describes. Time spent inside one of her tales is like taking a vacation from wherever you are. You’re transported to a better place, one of wonder, discovery and awe, one populated by fascinating people and lifetime experiences. ... Not only could she hold her own with the boys, but she had a magical charm about her that bedazzled us all. ... Go in peace, my friend Anne.’

‘We happily agree to abandon our schedule, stop whenever we feel like it, eat when hungry, and surf when the waves beckon. It seems there’s something worth exploring at every twist and turn of the road.’
