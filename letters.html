          <h2>December 18, 2007</h2>
          <p>
My dear Jenny, Lady Cat of many names and colors and meows,
          </p><p>
          	How long we have been together—several cat lives, I think. And we will always be together—remember that, cat!
          </p>
<p>
  	It is December, the month you were born 28 years ago. I gave birth to you, with Doctor Padrig Carney, at Memorial Hospital. You had so many visitors standing by to see the first grandchild of the family. The name Jennifer was chosen because in Keltic it means "white wave" and I knew you were a water-baby, blond and blue-eyed (which turned a deep brown!)—that also made you a wood or forest fairy.
          </p>
<p>
  	I remember holding you and thinking: what a miracle! I never wanted to stop holding you—the thought of a babysitter taking my place was unthinkable! But your grandmothers knew best—share her—and they did, though with a bit of jealousy or envy, even! You were curious about everything, walked at one-year, talked a lot, loved music and stuffed animals and colors and pretty clothes..."Didis"...(but mostly naked except for diapers! You carried 10 of them). You learned fast—almost as if you couldn't get enough. Your father and I took you to Bolsa Chica in a playpen on weekends (you ate sand). He and I would exchange time in the water with you in the sand...
